## Interface Elements Still Needed (All 3 Pages)

From lines 287-311 (Page 1), with similar patterns for Pages 2 & 3:

### On Every Card Throughout the Tool:

#### Worldview Cards:
- [ ] Button: "Suggest improvements ‚Üí"
- [ ] Context prompt: "Help us refine this description"

#### Outcome Cards:
- [ ] Button: "Suggest different worldview tags ‚Üí"
- [ ] Context prompt: "Should this outcome have different interest levels?"

#### Problem Cards:
- [ ] Button: "Is this accurate? Share feedback ‚Üí"
- [ ] Context prompt: "Adjust worldview relevance tagging"

#### Project Cards:
- [ ] Button: "Update categorization ‚Üí"
- [ ] Context prompt: "Your project addresses problems we haven't linked it to?"

### Persistent Elements:
- [ ] Stat display: "X improvements made by the community this month"
- [ ] Quick feedback form (2-3 fields max, low friction)

## Quick Win Option

If you want to see immediate progress, I recommend:

**Option A**: Apply V3 to main `/change-pathways` page NOW
- Copy all V3 changes to main page
- Users immediately see updated numbers and modals
- Can work on Pages 2 & 3 separately

**Option B**: Focus on completing one full page at a time
- Complete Strategic Elements Explorer first (PAGE 2)
- Then Ecosystem Map (PAGE 3)
- Then apply all to production

**Option C**: Create all modals first, then integrate
- Faster to see all content
- Integration happens in one sweep
- Less back-and-forth

Which approach would you prefer?

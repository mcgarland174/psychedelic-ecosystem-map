- Rick Perry + psychedelics bipartisan story
- Dr. Mark Hyman → Rockefeller influence path

## 3.3 What Worked: Successful Approaches ✅

### Strategic Success Patterns ✅

**1. Unusual Allies Create Breakthroughs** ✅
- Conservative champions for progressive causes
- Example: Governor Rick Perry + psychedelic therapy in Texas
- Veterans' organizations + stigmatized therapies = policy acceleration
- Learning: Cross-ideological coalitions unlock bipartisan support

**2. Capacity Building > Direct Service** ✅
- Training BIPOC farmers to advocate → 68% won federal grants
- Facilitator training = workforce infrastructure for VA adoption
- Advocacy skills transfer = sustained policy influence
- Learning: Skills transfer creates systemic change

**3. Research Credibility Enables Narrative Shifts** ✅
- Flourish research cited by policymakers (Rick Perry op-ed)
- Food ideology research reframed divisive debates
- Evidence-based advocacy accelerates policy timelines
- Learning: Science-to-policy translation is critical

**4. Early Support + Strategic Withdrawal** ✅
- Athanatos: Heavy early support → strategic step back → sustainable ecosystem
- Seed grants at right moment = 10x to 1,000x multipliers
- Learning: Timing and exit strategy matter

**5. Convening Power as Leverage** ✅
- Inaugural convenings launch entire fields
- Strategic gatherings attract new funders
- Network effects compound over time
- Example: HAF small groups → immediate peer knowledge sharing

**6. Cross-Sector Integration** ✅
- Arts + food + mental health = "Mission Belonging"
- Linking domains creates unexpected synergies
- Holistic approaches drive deeper transformation

**7. Community-Based Healing Consistently Works** ✅
- Nature programs, poetry, adventure therapy all successful
- Peer-to-peer mentorship exceptional outcomes
- Examples: First Descents, Mission Within, Veterans groups

**8. Public-Private Partnerships Bridge Critical Gaps** ✅
- Unreasonable Goals: State Dept + philanthropy + private sector
- Sundance Boulder: Municipal + private funding
- Rachel Yehuda VA: Federal + foundation funding
- Learning: Philanthropy addresses gaps where markets/government fall short

### Operational Success Factors ✅

**Economic Viability Integration** ✅
- Tax incentives (FarmLink, Goodr)
- Technical assistance + market development (Mad Agriculture)
- Economic models working for multiple stakeholders

**Outcome-Based Verification** ✅

- Software interventions at bottlenecks produce outsized impact

**Distributed Models Can Scale** ✅
- MakeSoil: 70+ countries, 4.5K tons/year without centralized infrastructure
- Community-based networks aggregate to large-scale impact

## 3.4 What Didn't Work: Honest Failures & Challenges ✅💬

### Strategic Blindspots ✅

**1. Over-Reliance on Catalytic Individuals** ✅
- **Problem**: Impact depends on singular champions, not networks
- **Consequence**: Fragility when key individuals leave/burn out
- **Learning**: Networks, not individuals, create lasting systemic change
- **Action**: Invest in coalition-building, multi-leader convenings, cross-org policy alliances

**2. Regional Dilution** ✅
- **Problem**: Portfolio spread too thin across geographies
- **Consequence**: Reduced ability to layer multiple interventions in single ecosystems
- **Learning**: Geographic concentration enables deeper transformation
- **Action**: Deep-focus on 2-3 regions for proof-of-concept showcases

**3. Under-Investment in Policy Infrastructure** ✅
- **Problem**: Insufficient long-term policy advocacy investment
- **Consequence**: Risk of stalled impact when federal systems move slowly
- **Learning**: Policy investment must be balanced with multiple pathways
- **Action**: Fund parallel pilots + state-level innovation + private-sector alternatives

**4. "Trust the Ripples" Weak on Accountability** ✅
- **Problem**: Philosophy inspiring but difficult to demonstrate to co-funders
- **Consequence**: Weakened credibility with other funders, missed collaboration opportunities
- **Learning**: Pattern of influence strengthens credibility
- **Action**: Develop lightweight ripple-tracking (1-question surveys, ecosystem maps, contribution stories)

**5. Grantee Capacity Constraints Undermined Catalytic Bets** ✅
- **Problem**: Organizations couldn't execute due to communications, capacity, staffing gaps
- **Consequence**: Impact limited by grantee capacity rather than program quality
- **Learning**: Catalytic funding requires execution capacity, not just programmatic support
- **Action**: Build in capacity stipends, pooled communications, shared services

**6. Arts & Communications Under-Resourced** ✅
- **Problem**: Powerful approach to arts (documentary as transformation) overshadowed by other portfolios
- **Consequence**: Lost opportunities to amplify systemic shifts through narrative
- **Learning**: Arts are not separate portfolio but amplification strategy for all work
- **Action**: Frame arts/communications as force multiplier across all portfolios

**7. Premature Exit From Ecosystems** ✅
- **Problem**: Stepping back too soon after seeding initiatives
- **Consequence**: Loss of momentum when support withdraws before sustainability
- **Learning**: Catalytic funding requires follow-through beyond seeding
- **Action**: "Glide path funding" - multi-year declining support for stabilization

**8. "Healing" Language Alienating to Pragmatic Co-Funders** ✅
- **Problem**: Authentic framing powerful internally but creates barrier to mainstream philanthropy
- **Consequence**: Isolation from potential co-funders, missed leverage opportunities
- **Learning**: Authentic framing can coexist with strategic translation
- **Action**: Translate "healing" to sector-specific language (resilience, access, belonging)

**9. Edge Work Creates Isolation** ✅
- **Problem**: Funding stigmatized topics sets FT apart but risks isolation from conservative funders
- **Consequence**: Difficulty attracting co-funders for controversial work
- **Learning**: Edge work and mainstream accessibility can coexist
- **Action**: Pair edge bets with bridge projects that draw in broader funders

**10. Convening Requires Sustained Relationship Management** ✅
- **Problem**: ReFED low engagement post-grant despite strategic importance
- **Consequence**: Lost opportunity for ecosystem coordination
- **Learning**: Convening organizations can't be "set and forget" investments
- **Action**: Budget for sustained funder engagement with convening roles

**11. Movement Building Gap** ✅
- **Problem**: Individual farm transitions didn't catalyze broader farmers' movement needed for policy transformation
- **Consequence**: Technical assistance alone insufficient for systemic change
- **Learning**: Absence of grassroots movement limits policy change potential
- **Action**: Dedicated investment in grassroots organizing and leadership development

### Specific Failed Programs 💬🔍

# SECTION 5: GRANTMAKING FRAMEWORKS & PROCESSES
*[Audiences: I, G, F]*

## 5.1 Decision-Making Frameworks ✅⚠️

### Concentric Circles Model ✅
*MOST IMPORTANT DECISION FRAMEWORK*

**Circle 1 (Center): Lived Experience** - HIGHEST INVESTMENT
- Issues with deep personal/family experience
- Leveraged lived experience as primary qualification
- Example: Mental health/trauma from Christiana's own journey
- Characteristics:
  - Highest funding capacity
  - Deepest engagement
  - Longest time horizons
  - Most risk tolerance

**Circle 2: Trusted Mentors** - ACTIVE LEARNING
- Following experienced leaders in adjacent fields
- Active engagement and questioning
- "Beginner's mind" while following experts
- Example: Following psychedelic researchers, community trauma experts
- Characteristics:
  - Moderate funding amounts
  - Active learning orientation
  - Guided risk-taking

**Circle 3: Collaborative/"Crowd" Funding** - SHARED RISK
- Jump in with other philanthropists
- Collective efforts and initiatives
- Lower individual commitment, shared risk
- Example: Multi-funder collaboratives, ecosystem initiatives
- Characteristics:
  - Lower funding amounts per initiative
  - Shared due diligence
  - Network learning opportunities

**Circle 4: Experimental "Say Yes" Grants** - EXPLORATION
- Small experimental grants
- Testing new ideas and relationships
- Low risk, high learning potential
- Characteristics:
  - Small grant amounts
  - Quick decisions
  - Learning focused, not outcome focused

**Strategic Implication**: Portfolio should be weighted toward center circles, with decreasing investment as you move outward.

### Avoiding Savior Complex Framework ✅

**Core Principles**:
1. **Never Be Sole Funder**
   - Prevents dependency
   - Ensures community buy-in
   - Validates market/ecosystem need
   - Forces organizations to build diverse funding base

2. **Ensure Community Buy-In**
   - Multiple stakeholders must be invested
   - Can't rescue, must empower
   - Community ownership essential for sustainability

3. **Focus on Empowerment Over Rescue**
   - Build capacity, don't create dependency
   - Transfer skills and knowledge
   - Strategic withdrawal after seeding

### Balance Test: Analysis + Intuition ✅

**Two Dimensions Must Align**:
1. **Personal Dimension**: Does this resonate with lived experience?
2. **Analytical Dimension**: What does field analysis say?

**Red Flags**:
- Pure intuition alone = "hero worship pitfalls"
- Pure analysis alone = misses human element
- **Best grants combine both approaches**
- Example: McLean grant (personal mental health history + strategic ketamine research analysis)

### Theory Expression Framework ✅

**Mindset Shift**: Grantees as expressions of theories, not endpoints

**Enables**:
- Portfolio coherence (testing related theories)
- Learning across investments (pattern recognition)
- Willingness to sunset or pivot (theories evolve)
- Focus on intervention points, not organizations

**Example**: Food systems grantees were testing different intervention points:
- Tax incentives (FarmLink)
- Technology optimization (Afresh)
- Community networks (MakeSoil)
- Outcome verification (Savory)
- Market mechanisms (Land to Market)

              Different perspectives on what should change in the psychedelic ecosystem. From harm reduction to clinical legitimacy to indigenous sovereigntyâ€”each represents a distinct vision for the field's future. These aren't mutually exclusive; most stakeholders hold multiple worldviews simultaneously.

              1. Start with What Resonates
            </h4>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-3" style={{ color: '#4A4643' }}>
              Click on a <strong>Worldview</strong> that aligns with your perspective. See which outcomes and problems matter most to stakeholders who share that view. Or start with a specific <strong>Problem</strong> you're working on and trace backwards to see which worldviews prioritize solving it.

            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-3" style={{ color: '#4A4643' }}>
              Click on any element to see its relationships. When you select a worldview, you'll see which outcomes it prioritizes. Select an outcome to see which problems block it and which projects address those problems. The connections reveal strategic alignment opportunities.

            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-3" style={{ color: '#4A4643' }}>
              Look for overlaps. Where do different worldviews share the same outcomes? Which problems block multiple desired changes? These convergence points often represent the strongest opportunities for collaboration and coordination.

            <p className="leading-relaxed" style={{ color: '#4A4643' }}>
              Notice where worldviews diverge. Some outcomes matter greatly to one perspective but not to others. Some problems are prioritized differently. These differences aren't failuresâ€”they're features. Understanding them helps navigate strategic decisions and resource allocation.
